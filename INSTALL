If you have a Unix-like system (e.g. Solaris, linux, Mac OS X) and Perl 5, you
should be ready to go. Kiko> should consume virtually no resources, and 
can be used with any shared-memory machine (i.e. any standard PC) with 
any number of cores: from 1 to n.

To install kiko you need first to place the Perl source code (kiko) somewhere 
it is accessible -- it has to be in your path. If you do not have root access, 
you could place it in a directory in your home (e.g. ~/bin/) and add that to 
your path by setting in your .cshrc (Cshell users)

set path=($path ~/bin)

or in your .profile (bash or korn shell users)

export PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

Kiko> uses a directory to store files and keep track of its assignments.
By default this is the .kiko directory in your home directory, although
you can change that by editing the Perl source file. To create this
directory before you begin using kiko> you can invoke

kiko --setup

To get started, a brief help is printed by calling

kiko --help

and more details are given in the manual at
